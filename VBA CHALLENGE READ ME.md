Title- Homwork Module 2 VBA Challenge
Conner Dekok

Collaboration with other students- None for the full length of this assignment.  I had some brainstorming sessions with other students to help get the assignment started, and took information from other studentsâ€™ questions and answers that were given during class and in our slack channels.   
Example-
Students I had asked questions or advice- Nicholas Fussy, and Yara El Emam

I attached files in this GitHub file with my Q1 through Q4 stock results with the script ran.
I also used  this question asked by Micah Springer to help figure out how to calculate the values of greatest increase, greatest decrease and greatest volume.

When considering this question, I used this post on Stackoverflow to help come up with how to calculate the values needed for calculating the greatest increase, greatest decrease and greatest volume.

In terms of correcting my code I also used Ai resources such as Microsoft Co Pilot to help debug my code when I ran into issues. This was used to help with formatting issues or error codes I had gotten when creating my code.
